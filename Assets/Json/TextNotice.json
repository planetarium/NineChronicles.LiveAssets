We look forward to your ideas and participation.\n\n## <b>25 Last Event Dungeon - Golden Dust Valut Open</b>\n\n- A year-end seasonal event dungeon where you can obtain Golden Dust and Sapphire Dust has been added.\n\n## <b>NCU 2nd Project – Teaser Banner Update</b>\n\n- A new NCU project is on the way — one that both new players on a new platform and long-time Nine Chronicles fans will be able to enjoy together.\n- In this project, you’ll play through content tied to Nine Chronicles’ main story, *Odin’s Conspiracy*. We’re also working hard on features that let you make payments with WNCG in external environments.\n- In addition, we’re carefully reviewing many of the high-quality projects from the recent game jam to see if they can be integrated into NCU. We’d really appreciate your interest and support.\n\n## Game Improvements\n\n- A red dot indicator is now shown on the 2nd Anniversary event popup when Recon rewards are available to claim."
